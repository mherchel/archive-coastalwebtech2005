          Like the look of our new website? Whatever the answer (hopefully it was yes), the chances are that you made your mind up within the first twentieth of a second. </p>
              <p>We all know that first impressions count, but researchers have shown 
                that judge websites within the blink of an eye (<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060109/full/060109-13.html">click here for more info</a>). 
                This first impression is vital to your organization. If your website 
                is old, ugly, or out of date, the impression will be overtly counterproductive. 
                On the other hand, if the user sees a modern, stylish web presence, 
                they will have a very positive impression of your organization</p>
          <p>This is where Coastal Web Technologies comes in!</p>
          <p>Coastal Web Technologies designs and develops websites, graphics, and ecommerce solutions within the greater North Florida area. We realize there are several different goals to have a well designed and functioning website </p>

                  that providing critical and up to date information to your customers

                  returning to your website frequently for new information and 
                  updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Look and Feel </strong>- For many clients, your website 
                  is the first impression that they get of your organization.

                  potential clients view of your business. Does your current website 
                  reflect your organization's current level of professionalism 
                  and attention to detail?</li>
                <li><strong>Organization</strong> - A pretty picture is just the 
                  beginning, but in most cases, an effective website is built

                  gone to a website, only to find it sluggish and unresponsive?

                  includes size of the webpages, server responsiveness, and database 
                  design. Coastal Web Technologies' websites excel at these criteria, 
                  which makes your website speedy and responsive.</li>
                <li><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong> - How can you
