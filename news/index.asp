We have been so busy over the last six months that upkeep on our own site and marketing collateral has slipped by the wayside.  In the last two month&rsquo;s however, we have hired two very talented designers to let us come up for air and are now ready to present our new site to the public.  We feel that our site now effectively communicates our talents, and showcases our current projects.</p>
          <p>A main goal of the new site is to provide current information on projects we have recently finished and news about our growth in North Florida.  Please check back frequently to see the latest sites and development projects.</p><hr />
          <p><strong>March 5th, 2006</strong> &ndash; <strong>Coastal Web Partners with The St. Augustine Record</strong>.  Coastal Web Tech is exited to announce a partnership with the St. Augustine Record.  The Record has asked Coastal Web to engineer an iFrame Surf Report for The Record&rsquo;s new website.  The development of the iFrame required engineering a database driven webpage that interfaces directly with the surf report database in real time.  Take a look at <a href="http://www.staugustine.com/surfreport.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.staugustine.com/surfreport.shtml</a> to see the end results&hellip; The site should launch soon!!! </p><hr />
